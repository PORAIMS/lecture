                <h3>What is Robotics?</h3>
                <p>Robotics is a field of engineering and science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robots are programmable machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often replicating or enhancing human actions. The study of robotics integrates multiple disciplines, including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and control systems.

                    Robots can be found in various forms, ranging from industrial robots used in manufacturing to autonomous vehicles and medical robots assisting in surgeries. They are designed to perform repetitive, dangerous, or complex tasks that might be difficult or hazardous for humans. The field of robotics is also closely associated with artificial intelligence (AI), where robots are equipped with the ability to learn, adapt, and make decisions based on their environment.

                <h3>Definition of a Robot:</h3>
                <p>
                    A robot is a programmable, electromechanical machine capable of performing a series of tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often designed to replicate or augment human actions. Robots typically consist of mechanical components (such as joints, arms, or wheels), sensors, actuators, and control systems that enable them to interact with their environment. The primary purpose of robots is to execute tasks that may be repetitive, dangerous, or require a level of precision beyond human capability.

                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mechanical Structure - </span>A robot's body comprises parts like joints, wheels, and arms, which allow it to move and interact with the physical world ("Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control" by John J. Craig).</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sensors and Actuators -</span> Sensors collect information from the environment, while actuators translate this information into movements. Together, they enable robots to perform tasks such as grasping objects or navigating spaces ("Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control" by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park).</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Control Systems - </span>Robots are equipped with control systems that manage their operations, ensuring they respond appropriately to inputs and execute tasks as programmed. These systems include software algorithms that allow for precise control, motion planning, and sometimes learning capabilities ("Robotics: Modelling, Planning, and Control" by Bruno Siciliano et al.).</li>
